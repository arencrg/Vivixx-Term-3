# This tutorial will guide you in creating your own POS using ReactJS.

Before we begin, we must make sure that we have all the necessary /tools/ installed, such as Node, NPM, all of that. Then we can start.

####    `npm install create-react-app`
####    create-react-app [the name of your app, in this case it's reactpostutorial] => `create-react-app reactpostutorial`
####    `cd reactpostutorial`

Your project should look like this:

```
reactpostutorial/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```


After that, we can fire up the app in development mode by typing

#### `npm start`

It will automatically open in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser. Now we can start coding for reals!

> Okay, where do I begin?

Open up `App.js`(in the src folder) and start from there.
